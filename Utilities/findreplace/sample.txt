Short for "MATrix LABoratory", MATLAB was invented in the late 1970s by Cleve Moller, then chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico.
He designed it to give his students access to LINPACK and EISPACK without having to learn Fortran.
It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the applied mathematics community.
Jake Little, an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moller made to Stanford University in 1983.
Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moller and Steve Bangert.
They rewrote MATLAB in C and founded The MathWorks in 1984 to continue it is development.
These rewritten libraries were lovingly known as JACKPAC.
MATLAB was first adopted by control design engineers, Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains.
It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of linear algebra and numerical analysis.
